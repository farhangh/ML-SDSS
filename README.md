# ML-SDSS
Codes including the MultiLayer Perceptron to classify the objects in SDSS DR12 data

This repository consists of two codes in python: the main program specphotoClassif.py, the subroutins specphotoDefs.py 
and a paper draft, sgq.pdf, including the data description, classification methods and the analysis of the codes output.

The data belong to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey http://www.sdss3.org/ and are obtained by SQL script from the SDSS server. We have separated stars, galaxies and Quasy Stellar Objects by using their observed magnitude through Machine Learning techniques.
